### Abstract 
Pick any sport, pick any high performing athlete and ask **"Is there an underlying framework for their extraordinary performance ?".**   

This document is only meant for defining components of fitness, not on the methods to achieve them. 

#### Definition 
While one might argue, and do so correctly that athletes aren't the only ones who are fit; But **my definition of fitness is limited to athletic fitness** and even more specifically fitness required for high performance in **Running and Badminton.**
